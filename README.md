# About Safety Net.
Safety Net. is a web-based prototype developed during Hackathon Vienna 2025 as part of the BMI Challenge. The platform aims to prevent radicalization and extremism by combining interactive storytelling, knowledge quizzes, and self-check tools to raise awareness and promote early detection of risky behavior.

Users can anonymously submit reports, which are evaluated using a simple keyword-based heuristic to estimate potential risk. Safety Net is designed to educate, empower, and enable early intervention through engaging and accessible digital tools.
